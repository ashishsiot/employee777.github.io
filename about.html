        <p>Where should I start? Well I grew up in house with 5 older brother and no sisters I guess would be a good start. I ended up joining the military in order to pay for college and persue my career in software development. While I was in, I leanred many things about computers, electronics, and machines as a Fire-Controlman. After my contract was up I decided to go back home and continue to pursue my career. The things I like to do for fun are pretty simple. I play RPG games and table top game with my friends as well as watch anime. My hobbies include but are not limited to: illustrating, pixel art, car repair, electronic repairs (laptops and other pcbs), sleeping and eating.</p>
